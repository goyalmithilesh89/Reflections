How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?


It helps to compare each line of code of both files so we can find the bug by looking at two lines.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Because whenever I am stuck with a new bug, I can check my previous version of my file to find it.m
